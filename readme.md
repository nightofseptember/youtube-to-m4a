This is just an very simple script to make it easier to download YT Videos in m4a-formatand making it usable by most DAP's.
 - It downloads it as M4A and the PNG, NOT VIDEO.

Requirements: You need FFMPEG, ffprobe, ffmpeg and yt-dlp

1. First download ffmpeg and yt-dlp, then ctrl + c either singe link / playlist version of the script-

2. Create a txt/notepad file, and ctrl + v into there.

3. then save it as "XX.bat" and "all files" in filetype. 

4.  then you should be able to run it and then just follow the instructions.

Note: I do not own or have developed FFMPEG, yt-dlp. All rights go to them.
