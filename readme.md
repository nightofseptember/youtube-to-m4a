This is just an very simple script to make it easier to download YT Videos in m4a-format
and making it usable by most DAP's

You press yt-m4a.bat

Ctrl + V youtube link
    - Make sure the youtube link doesnt have &list or &radio-1 in it.
    
and it will automatically download the youtube video in M4A format
